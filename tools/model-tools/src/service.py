"""The HTTP face of Model Tools (T-0377, DM-10, DM-12, DM-17, DM-18, DM-19).

Two callers and one contract (API/01 §11). The Portal's LinkML editor posts a source on every
pause in typing and renders what comes back; the import wizard browses the Smart Data Models
catalogue and asks for one model of it. Both reach Model Tools through the Portal and never
directly, so this app has no ingress, no session, no credentials and no state that outlives a
request except the catalogue cache DM-12 asks for.

```text
GET  /healthz     is the process up, and which generator version is in this image
GET  /catalog     the Smart Data Models catalogue index, cached (`?refresh=true` refills now)
POST /generate    {"source": "<LinkML YAML>"}  -> the artifact set
POST /import-sdm  {"model": "dataModel.X/Y"}   -> the same set, plus the LinkML it produced
```

The routes call the same functions as the command line, so a preview, `jcctl model generate`
and CI cannot disagree about what a model compiles to (DM-19).
