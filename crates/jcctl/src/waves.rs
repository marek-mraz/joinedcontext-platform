//! Sync-wave ordering of a repository (T-0126, CC-18, Architecture/06 section 3).
//!
//! The order comes from the kind alone. Research verdict P4 rejects a free-form
//! dependency DAG, so a plan is the repository bucketed into the six waves of
//! Architecture/06 section 3 and nothing more: no reference graph, no cycles, no
//! deadlock to detect. Within a wave the kinds converge in the documented order, which
//! puts a `DataModel` before the `Mapping` that targets it and a `ScopeDefinition`
//! before the `Policy` that names it.
