//! What a derived pipeline compiles into (T-0140, PL-31, PL-33, PL-34, PL-34a, PL-37).
//!
//! [`super::pipelines::runtime_of`] decides *where* a pipeline runs; this decides what the
//! generated `bento.yaml` reads, what it computes with, and what the platform has to hold for it
//! while it runs. A derived pipeline is the one shape whose input is the platform itself: it
//! reads entities out of a Context Space through an Endpoint, computes, and writes entities back
//! through another (Architecture/08, "Derived pipelines").
//!
//! Three rules are enforced here rather than left to the runtime.
//!
//! A `wasm` compute renders against the digest the build lane published and against nothing else
//! (PL-34a): no digest, no processor, no runtime. A pipeline whose module has not been built yet
//! deploys nothing rather than re-running the module from last week, which is the same rule an
//! App follows for its image.
//!
//! A resident pipeline that writes the type its own subscription watches feeds its own trigger,
//! and is refused unless the manifest says the loop is deliberate (PL-37). The decision is made
//! on the entity type, because the type is the only thing both sides declare: `output` carries no
//! attribute list, so nothing here can claim the compute misses the watched attributes.
//!
//! And a source declares one input, never two. `PipelineSource::validate` already refuses an
//! Endpoint and a DataSource together; this refuses a query and a subscription trigger together,
//! for the same reason: two inputs is a merge nobody can review.
