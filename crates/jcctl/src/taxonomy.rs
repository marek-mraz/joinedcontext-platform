//! The role taxonomy every organization starts from (PF-56, PF-71, T-0873).
//!
//! Eight roles, written as `Role` manifests into `users/roles/`: what a person may read, what
//! each kind of editor may propose, who approves, and who may let data out to the public. They
//! are a seed a person extends by proposing further roles, never a list the platform enforces:
//! `jcctl roles seed` writes a file only where there is none, so an edited role stays edited.
//!
//! "Every project kind" is read from the catalogue rather than typed out, so a kind added to
//! `jc-core` tomorrow is covered by the seed the day it lands.
