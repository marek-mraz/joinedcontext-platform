//! The `SyncSource` loop: when a run is due, whether the source moved, and what proposal a
//! run becomes (T-0142, MF-27…MF-31).
//!
//! A sync run is an import with a schedule in front of it. That is not a simplification of
//! the requirement, it is the requirement: MF-28 says every run goes through the standard
//! import gates, so this module runs [`crate::commands::import::collect`] rather than a
//! second, laxer path, and turns its report into the `kind: Change` envelope
//! [`crate::lanes`] already builds for every other proposal. A sync that could merge what an
//! import would refuse would be the way around MF-24.
//!
//! Nothing here opens a socket, clones a repository or talks to a forge. Like the CKAN
//! publisher, the registration reconciler and the foreign-model mirror next door, the
//! transport is a trait the caller implements: it is the caller that resolved
//! `source.*.secretRef` and holds the credential, and no type in this module has a field a
//! token could live in (MF-31). Pushing the branch and opening the merge request belongs to
//! the same caller — this module decides *what* the proposal is, and hands back the manifests
//! to write and the envelope to open it with.
//!
//! Nothing is written either: [`poll`] is the whole judgement, and the caller writes the
//! files of an accepted [`Proposal`] onto a branch. A run whose plan is empty produces no
//! proposal at all, so a source that has not moved does not put a merge request on the forge
//! every half hour (CC-18).
