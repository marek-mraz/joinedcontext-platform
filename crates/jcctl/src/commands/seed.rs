//! `plan` and `apply` over the seed entities of a repository (CC-72, CC-18, T-0421).
//!
//! The repository declares them, the broker holds them, and the difference is the whole live
//! state a reconciler has left to converge: everything else a component reads from Git by
//! itself. A second run over an unchanged repository sends no write, which is what makes
//! `apply` safe to run on every restore, every upgrade and every hour.
