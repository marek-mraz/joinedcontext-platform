//! Serving one space as somebody else's model (T-0175, EP-54, DM-51, DM-52).
//!
//! An Endpoint with `spec.viewMappingRef` publishes the *target* model of a Mapping. The
//! broker knows only the source model, so the gateway stands in the middle and runs the
//! Mapping's compiled IR in both directions: the caller's query is inverted on the way out,
//! and every entity is rebuilt on the way back.
//!
//! The IR is the JSON artifact Model Tools compiles from the same specification as the
//! Bloblang Bento runs, and DM-39's golden tests run against both, so the two executors
//! cannot answer differently. Nothing here parses LinkML-Map: this module only interprets an
//! IR that was already reduced to the invertible subset DM-51 allows.
//!
//! A computed (`expr`) slot is the one entry that is neither inverted nor read straight from
//! the broker: the IR carries its expression as a typed tree, and this module evaluates that
//! tree over the attributes the entity already has. Nothing here parses a language, for the
//! same reason the rest of the IR carries precomputed tables rather than rules.
//!
//! A view is read only. A mapping is invertible per slot, not per entity — a required source
//! slot no target slot derives has no value to reconstruct, and a constant or an `expr` slot
//! has none at all — so a write in the target model is refused rather than half-inverted.
