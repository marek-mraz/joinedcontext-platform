//! An accepted ODRL 2.2 agreement, compiled into the `Policy` entities that enforce it
//! (T-0179, DS-10, DS-03, R26, R52, MIM3-R10).
//!
//! Negotiation ends in a document; enforcement reads manifests. This module is the one step
//! between them, and it is deliberately the only one: a consumer's access is whatever the
//! compiled `Policy` says, so an agreement that was never compiled grants nothing at all, and
//! an agreement compiled twice produces the same policies.
//!
//! Reading the document is not re-implemented here. [`access_odrl::read`] already takes an
//! ODRL document apart into the six R26 names, because the access surface has to round-trip
//! its own output; a second parser would be a second opinion about what an agreement says.
//!
//! **The ceiling (DS-03).** A negotiated agreement is a subset of an offer, and nothing in the
//! document itself proves that. So every compiled policy is checked against the offered
//! endpoint's own policies and the compilation fails if it would reach further:
//!
//! | dimension | rule |
//! |---|---|
//! | operations, entity types | must be offered; anything else is refused |
//! | attributes | the offer's whitelist wins; an agreement naming none inherits it |
//! | `q`, `scopeQ` | conjunction of both, because a filter the agreement did not repeat is still in force |
//! | `geoQ`, `temporalQ` | the offer's when the agreement names none; a different one is refused |
//!
//! The last row is where this compiler declines to be clever. Deciding that one polygon lies
//! inside another, or one interval inside another, is geometry and calendar arithmetic; a
//! wrong answer silently widens a fence somebody drew on a map. Refusing is the only answer
//! that cannot be wrong.
