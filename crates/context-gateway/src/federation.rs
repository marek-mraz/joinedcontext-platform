//! What the gateway knows about a space's registrations (T-0345, EP-70, EP-71, PF-48).
//!
//! A hub endpoint has no code path of its own. The gateway pins the tenant of the space and
//! forwards, and the broker does the distributed operation CIM 009 clause 4.3.6 defines: it
//! matches the query against its registrations, forwards, merges and protects itself against a
//! loop. That is the whole read path, and this module adds nothing to it.
//!
//! What it does hold is the one thing the gateway has to decide before forwarding: whose
//! identity a forward carries. `serviceAccount` is the mode the platform implements; `caller`
//! needs an RFC 8693 token exchange that does not exist yet, and a hub that silently forwarded
//! its own account instead would be a widening nobody wrote down (PF-48).
//!
//! It also holds the member names, which the MCP surface lists so a tool description can say
//! what an endpoint federates. Names only: an address never leaves this platform (EP-71).
