//! The in-memory endpoint table (T-0144, EP-17, EP-18, EP-19, EP-03).
//!
//! Every request on the endpoint surface starts by turning an opaque slug into the space
//! behind it, so this lookup is on the hot path of the whole gateway. The table is read
//! far more often than it is written: the reconciler replaces it when an `Endpoint`
//! changes, readers never block, and a reader that is mid-request keeps the snapshot it
//! started with (EP-18, EP-19).
//!
//! The table answers with the space name only after the slug matched. An unknown slug
//! yields nothing at all, so the caller cannot learn whether a space exists behind a slug
//! it guessed (EP-03, EP-23).
