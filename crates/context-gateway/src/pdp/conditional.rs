//! Read, evaluate, then write conditionally (T-0152, R45, GW16).
//!
//! GW16 tests the payload a caller sent. That is the whole answer for a grant partitioned
//! by URN prefix, because an id never changes. It is only half of it for a grant that
//! carries a `q` or a polygon: the payload can sit inside the grant while the entity as it
//! is *stored* sits outside it, and between the check and the write the entity can move.
//!
//! So a write on such a grant is run the way RFC 9110 runs a conditional request. The
//! gateway reads the entity, evaluates the grant against what it read, and forwards the
//! write with `If-Match` set to the entity tag it read, which turns a lost race into a
//! `412` the caller can retry. The caller's own `If-Match` is checked by the same read.
//!
//! The `q` half is not evaluated here. The gateway sends the grant's own filter to the
//! broker and keeps what comes back, because a second implementation of the query language
//! is a second implementation that can disagree with the one holding the data.
