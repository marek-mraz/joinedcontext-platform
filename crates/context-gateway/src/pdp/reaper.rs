//! Revocation reaper: the running gateway follows the repository (T-0177, R48, EP-19, OPS-45).
//!
//! Everything the enforcement point decides with — the endpoint table, the policies of each
//! endpoint, the service accounts a token's `azp` may name — is a projection of the manifest
//! repository, read once at start-up. That is a cache, and R48 says a `Policy` change has to
//! reach it within a bounded time: until this module existed, revoking a grant meant
//! restarting the pod, and an emergency runbook that restarts pods is not a 5-second bound.
//!
//! The reaper is a poll, not a push, and deliberately so: the repository arrives as a
//! ConfigMap volume, a git-sync sidecar checkout or a plain directory, and none of those
//! sends an event. Every replica polls its own copy, so all of them converge inside one
//! interval without talking to each other and without an admin endpoint an attacker could
//! reach. The interval is one second, under the two the endpoint table is allowed (EP-19)
//! and well under the five a revocation has (OPS-45).
//!
//! A reload that fails changes nothing: the old table keeps serving. A repository that is
//! being written to (half-synced checkout, ConfigMap mid-swap) is briefly unreadable or
//! incomplete, and answering 404 for every endpoint because of it would be a worse outage
//! than serving a table one second old.
