//! What the data behind an endpoint contains, narrowed to the grant (T-0162, EP-46…EP-52).
//!
//! The gateway is not a compiler. `DataModel.spec.artifacts` names the files Model Tools
//! generated beside the LinkML source and committed in the same commit (DM-02), so what
//! an endpoint publishes is exactly what was reviewed. A model whose artifacts are not in
//! the checkout is still described: the JSON Schema and the `@context` are derived from
//! the grants, which is a narrower answer than the compiled one but never a wrong one.
//!
//! Whichever half answers, the document is a projection of the policy set: a class or a
//! slot the caller may not read is absent, and named in `redactedSlots` so the absence is
//! visible rather than mysterious (EP-47).
