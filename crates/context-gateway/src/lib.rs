//! The Context Gateway: the only way into context data (R1, ADR-N-003).
//!
//! Every request passes the same three stages. The PEP strips whatever the client claimed
//! about its own identity or tenancy and establishes both from the endpoint and the
//! verified token. The PDP turns the caller's grants into one verdict and, for the normal
//! case, the constraint set that narrows the request. The response is projected back down
//! to the attributes the grants actually cover, so nothing the caller may not see ever
//! reaches the wire.
