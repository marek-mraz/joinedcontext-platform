//! Token-bucket rate limiting per endpoint and caller (T-0154, EP-20, MIM0-R7, OPS-35).
//!
//! One bucket per `(slug, caller)`: the presented credential when there is one, the client
//! address when there is not. Keying an anonymous caller by address is the only thing a
//! public endpoint can key on, and keying a credentialed one by its digest is what stops
//! two clients behind one NAT from spending each other's quota.
//!
//! `spec.rateLimits.requestsPerMinute` is the steady rate and `burst` the bucket size, so
//! a caller may spend a burst at once and then goes at the steady rate. An endpoint that
//! declares no limits is not limited here; APISIX in front still has its own.
//!
//! The counter is in this process. Two replicas therefore allow up to twice the configured
//! rate, which is the honest trade for a limiter that costs a mutex and no round trip.
// ponytail: in-process buckets, one lock. A shared counter (Redis, the mesh) is a
// different component, and worth it only when a measurement says the per-replica bound
// is too loose.
