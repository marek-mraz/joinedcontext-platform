//! What the gateway concluded for itself never leaves in a header (T-0941, T-0942, SP-05, R22).
//!
//! Two rules, one layer: the tenant is pinned for the hop to the broker and never comes back
//! out, and the narrowing signal is answered only to a caller who asked for it. The layer is
//! tested here on its own, and through the real router in `space_surface_tests`, which is
//! what proves it is actually wired in.
