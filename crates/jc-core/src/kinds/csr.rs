//! Manifest kind for federation: where part of a space's data actually lives (T-0303, MF-36).
//!
//! A `ContextSourceRegistration` tells one Context Space's broker that entities matching a
//! claim are held somewhere else, so a query can be forwarded, merged and loop-protected by
//! the rules NGSI-LD already defines (CIM 009 clause 4.3.6). It is the manifest behind the hub
//! pattern of `Architecture/04 §5a`: a hub space holds only registrations and one Endpoint,
//! and that Endpoint answers over the union of the members.
//!
//! Two things this type refuses on purpose. A registration with no coverage claim, because a
//! source that claims nothing is matched by nothing and would be a silent no-op rather than a
//! federation. And a registration naming both a local Endpoint and an external address,
//! because the reconciler would have to choose one and the file would mean two things.
