//! `kind: Group`: the people a binding names at once, declared in `users/groups/` of the
//! Organization repository (T-0852, PF-62, PF-64, Architecture/12 §2a).
//!
//! Membership is configuration, not a console setting: the reconciler owns the Keycloak group of
//! each manifest, adds and prunes members to match, and reports what somebody changed by hand as
//! drift (PF-63). A member no Keycloak user carries yet is not an error here — the binding takes
//! effect at that person's first login (PF-04, PF-49) — so this kind checks the shape of an
//! address and nothing about who exists.
